Making a snake game with c programming using ncurses

This repository of making a snake game originates from moving the cursor in C.
After i could move the cursor and get some fruits displayed at random positions, i decided to make it more fun and share :)
If you like my stuff, simply show some appreciation by telling me what you think.
I'll keep updating the stuff. 
I hope it helps other learners too.
Took me a while to put all this together given my limited programming abilities but with all this, I think i've been able to improve on my programing knowledge.
Thank you for giving me suggestions. 
Thank you!!...
